        "What is Hot or Not?",
        "It is a short video content sharing platform, similar to Tik-Tok, built on the ICP (Internet Computer Protocol) blockchain. Hot or Not combines the entertainment of short-video social media with end-user monetisation by enabling users to speculate on the content and earn tokens (COYN token). Hot or not is the second version of GoBazzinga, developed by GoBazzinga inc. taking forward the vision to create a social media platform that financially rewards the consumers of the platform instead of advertisers.",

        "How does the Hot or Not monetisation work?",
        "The current app is the alpha version which does not contain the Hot or Not monetisation system. This will be added to the platform in the coming months, in accordance with GoBazzinga's Dfinity grant milestones.
              The platform will contain an in-app game called “Hot or Not”. Users can stake their COYN tokens on any video, on either “Hot” or “Not” outcomes, depending on their thoughts on the viral capacity of the video. 
              If the user stakes their token on the side of the majority, they win and earn double their tokens back. 
              If the user stakes their tokens on the minority side, they lose all the tokens staked on that particular video.
              Hot or Not also monetises content creation without relying on advertisers, by giving 10% of all tokens staked to the creator of the video, regardless of the outcome.",

We are awaiting the storage subnets so that we can later put these things on-chain as well. On this forum, at https://forum.dfinity.org/t/long-term-r-d-storage-subnets-proposal/9390, you can read more about the storage subnets. User experience, cost, and simplicity were taken into consideration when choosing Cloudflare over non-ICP on-chain services like IPFS. Our roadmap outlines our goal of becoming entirely on-chain as we are committed to creating a decentralised system where users have complete control over their data and content.",
